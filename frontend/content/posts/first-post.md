# Welcome to My First Blog Post

This is a debug blog post to demonstrate the comments functionality.

## What is this blog about?

This blog is a proof of concept for a vibe-coded self-hosted blog with comments functionality. It uses:

- Hugo for the static site generation
- Express.js for the backend API
- PostgreSQL for the database
- JWT for authentication

## How to use the comments system

It's not recommended, since I'll most likely loose the data.

1. Register an account or log in
2. Scroll to the bottom of any post
3. Write your comment and submit
4. Your comment will be posted immediately

## Lorem Ipsum

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam euismod, nisl eget aliquam ultricies, nunc nisl aliquet nunc, quis aliquam nisl nunc quis nisl. Nullam euismod, nisl eget aliquam ultricies, nunc nisl aliquet nunc, quis aliquam nisl nunc quis nisl.

### Code Example

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```
